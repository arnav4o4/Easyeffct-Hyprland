 - **But in hyprland  this service doen't work effectiverly**




So to run it on  **Hyprland** add the following line in `.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` file **:**


`exec = easyeffects --gapplication-service`



And then open **Easyeffect app** and close it again, You'll see , the app is running in background üòÅ 

**[ You can check it from your System Monitor ]**


## **Note:** 

### This only works on **<mark>Non-Flatpak version</mark>** and if you are using flatpack version, install the non flatpak version as Hyprland cant allow flatpak apps to run automatically on system startup.
